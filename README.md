## Improving Prior Authorization - By Care Catalysts

A system to optimize prior authorization and addressing the significant delays and inefficiencies that plague the healthcare system. By leveraging state-of-the-art GenAI, we sought to reduce delays, improve patient care, decrease administrative burdens, and streamline the overall process. We are using GenAI to summarize the patient medical history and using this medical history to estimate potential tests that may be asked by insurance company - making the process tedious and longer.

## Streamlined Prior Authorization Platform

Our solution addresses care delays caused by inefficient prior authorization, as highlighted by the AMA survey where 94% of physicians reported delays. The current system lacks transparency, causing resource waste and lower care quality, which leads to reduced hospital funding and patient satisfaction.

## Key Solution Features

1. Deidentified Patient Input: Providers enter deidentified patient records and treatment paths, ensuring privacy while enabling a clear review.
2. Instant Authorization Feedback: The platform provides real-time feedback on authorization likelihood, cutting down on unnecessary re-submissions.
3. Suggested Tests for Approval: AI-driven recommendations of required tests/documents increase chances of approval, aligning with insurer needs from the start.
4. Centralized Communication Hub: A single platform for providers and insurers to track and manage authorization requests, reducing delays.
   
## Benefits

- Faster Care Delivery: Immediate feedback and test recommendations reduce back-and-forth, minimizing delays.
- Resource Optimization: Lower administrative burden and fewer resubmissions save time and cost.
- Higher Satisfaction: Patients get timely care; providers experience less friction, improving outcomes for all stakeholders.

In essence, our platform bridges the communication gap, making prior authorization more efficient, transparent, and effective for both providers and payers.
