Response: No, Rejected. The prior authorization request for Infliximab (J1745) and high-dose Etanercept (J1438) has been rejected due to questionable medical necessity. The patient's mild, intermittent knee pain and mild osteoarthritis do not warrant the use of these high-cost medications. Additional imaging and diagnostic tests may be needed to support the need for these medications before a prior authorization can be approved. It is recommended to reassess the patient's pain management and consider alternative treatment options before reapplying for authorization.

 Does ['Infliximab (J1745) infusion for symptom management'] Need any prior authorizations.. And does the existing tests cover those authorization? Please let me know what needs to be done to make sure this drug gets authorized when we apply for Authorization

Response: No, Rejected - Infliximab (J1745) infusion for symptom management typically requires prior authorization for coverage as it is a biologic medication used for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. In this case, the patient's chief complaint of a common cold does not warrant the use of this medication, and it is not indicated for a runny nose and sore throat. Additionally, the patient's past medical history and physical examination do not suggest a need for Infliximab infusion. To ensure authorization for this medication, a more appropriate diagnosis or medical indication should be provided, along with supporting documentation or lab results indicating the need for such treatment.

Response: No, Rejected. The prior authorization request for Tocilizumab (J3262) injection for pain management has been rejected because there is no clear indication for such advanced treatment based on the patient's history of present illness, physical examination, and assessment. It is recommended to first try conservative treatment options for the minor backache before seeking authorization for Tocilizumab. The existing tests (lab results and imaging) do not support the use of Tocilizumab at this time.
